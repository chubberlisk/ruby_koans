  # If two lines are lexically scoped, it simply means that they occur 
  # within the same code block â€” regardless of what that code block may evaluate to. E.g.
  #
  # class B
  #   # x and y share the same lexical scope
  #   x = 1
  #   y = 1
  # end
  #
  # class B
  #   # z has a different lexical scope from x and y, even though it's in the same class.

  # QUESTION: Which has precedence: The constant in the lexical scope,
  # or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?
  #
  # In this case, the constant in the lexical scope.

  # In this case, the constant from the inheritance hierarchy.
